# Functional requirements

## Main use of purpose.

This application is meant to help you time manage courses, tasks and notes related to both. 

## Users

For now there can be only one main user at a time. 

## UI


The app  consists of 3 main windows, the basic, the Overview of courses and tasks, and finally the study timer. Rest of them are mainly used for quickly adding or setting something.

## Further development idea
 1. Linking courses to another.
 2. Exporting notes to text.
 3. Allowing multiple users
 4. Allowing user to set main window size prefrence.
 5. Exporting data to google drive.
 6. Allowing user set config.properties through the app itself.
 7. Adding a sounds to the study timer to help realize break is coming.
