# Manual

To try the application just download the file COS.jar and open it!
[COS.jar] (https://github.com/KirillosTY/Course-Overview-System/blob/3c356b95f53e11128cf166d50db6a25c6d4c198c/CourseOverviewSystem/COS/COS.jar)

You can start the file with the command:
```
java -jar COS.jar
``` 
or by going into the main folder named COS and running the following command:

```
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=Controls.MainController
```

Currently the only working thing is the work counter, which starts to count the time youve put in. Start it by pressing the "Start studying"-button.
